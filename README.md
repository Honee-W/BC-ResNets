# BC-ResNets  

## Broadcasting-residual network model zoo for Multiple Classification Tasks.
## Small but Effective

### unofficial implementation of 'Broadcasted Residual Learning for Efficient Keyword Spotting'

#### How to Use

`1. add this python file to your model directory`

`2. import the 'BCResNet' object and ready to go!`

### HyperParams Configurations

`num_classes: total classification classes based on your task`

`delta: channel scaling, refers to Ï„ in the original paper`

`aug: choose data augmentation or not`
